      We’re going to start with a classic running game, and look at each move from {{player}} and {{opponent}}’s Perspective.
      {{player}} goes first, rolling 6-5. 
      First, think of what {{player}}'s best move is.

    hint: |
      The correct play is 24/13.
      It’s a good opening roll. One of your two pieces at the back is now on its merry way home, safe and sound. It’s also setting you up to play a running game.

      Now, think of the worst possible move {{player}} can come up with. Does this leave two pieces open, and do little that will help {{player}} on their next move?
    xgid: XGID=-b----E-C---eE---c-e----B-:0:0:1:56:0:0:0:0:10
    hint: A very bad play here would be 13/7 8/3 - {{player}} would leave two open shots with different dice numbers to {{opponent}} who is trying to get those back pieces moving anyway.  There are so many rolls for {{opponent}} that hit a 3 or a 6 that you would already be hoping for miracles to avoid losing.

      {{opponent}} has 1 checker stuck behind a wall blocking the exit. Now there is no one roll that gets {{opponent}} to safety at point 13.

      Roll 4, {{player}} rolls 5-4. Now that {{opponent}} made the 5 point, they can think about escaping the back checker the next turn.
      {{player}} is well aware of that and wants to keep building that prime wall to stop {{opponent}}’s last checker from escaping.
      {{player}} is faced with the question,
    choices:
      - Make a point on the 2? 7/2, 6/2
      - Keep building the prime? 13/8, 13/9
    correct: 2
    xgid: XGID=-b----E-C---dF---bbe----A-:0:0:-1:45:0:0:0:0:10
    hint: |
      {{opponent}} is better off blocking {{player}} by building off the prime they already have. Are you worried about the open checker on the 9? The odds of hitting that spot is 4/36, 1/9. As you’ll begin to learn, an 11% chance of being hit is a great bargain in exchange for the chance to expand your prime. If {{opponent}} hits {{player}} next turn, the checker is advanced in the inner board more safely.

      1st: Double 4s fills out the 4 point in {{player}}’s inner board, and hits {{opponent}} on the 16 point. Distant 2nd is 6-2, which gets {{player}} out, increases {{opponent}}’s pip count, and costs half a roll next turn to get in. 3rd place, 4-6m; It leaves {{player}} praying that {{opponent}} doesn’t roll a 2 next turn. There’s an almost ⅓ chance {{opponent}} will roll a 2. That alone would make {opponent}} the strong favorite to win the game.

      Roll 5, {{player}} ends up rolling a 5-4
      It’s a chance for escape, and {{player}} takes the checker on the 24 point to the 15 point.
      If {{opponent}} rolls a 3 or a 2-1, {{player}} goes behind the wall and has to try to escape again. There’s about a ⅓ chance of it happening.
      This is a classic moment in the running game, {{player}} is a rabbit out in the open, a short hop from safety. Will Rabbit survive?

      {{player}} is in a strong position, but still needs to get the two back checkers home. Should {{player}} have moved one of them to the 21 spot with the 3 instead of the 9?

    xgid: XGID=-b----E-C---bF-aabbe-----A:0:0:-1:43:0:0:0:0:10
    hint: O’s job is to get out of the way of being hit. Having 3 pieces at the back and the other 12 on the other side of the board is like having 3 rabbits have to run through the open field. The correct move is to put a checker on the 9 point.

      Roll 13 {{player}} Rolls a 2-1      
      {{player}} is behind in the race, but there’s still a chance {{opponent}} will leave an open shot. The best thing {{player}} can do now is prepare the best defense for that possibility. {{player}} can’t think about moving his two back checkers right now.
      What’s {{player}}'s best move?

      - 7/6, 6/4
    correct: 1
    xgid: XGID=---ABBCbC-B--B--aaccbab---:0:0:-1:21:0:0:0:0:10
    hint: One move gives {{player}} more spare checkers to fill in the 2 and the 1 point in future rolls. The other move creates a 6 point prime, which can’t be escaped from. Presented with the choice, take the sure thing, especially when it’s the best thing.

    hint: It’s a bit of a trick question, because {{player}} must play a 6. It’s not possible to play a 6 on the 13 point or 10 point without leaving a piece for White to hit. The only place to play a six is on the 8 point. That leaves moving the spare checker on the 6 to the 3.

Also terrible is leaving two of O’s pieces open for being hit. The best move is to take the spare checker on the 7, and put it on the 2. It builds out the inner board without breaking your 6 point prime.

When you are in a race, you want to move the furthest back anchors toward the inner board. It will be harder for your other four pieces to get home if you go with 8/2, 8/6. 10/8, 10/4 leaves you with the most options, and critically, a spare checker insurance in case you roll a 6 and don’t want to break up your anchor on 13.

Leaving one open for {{opponent}} to hit just increases the chances {{opponent}} will win, not just by racing, but by keeping {{player}} on the bar. {{player}} moves one checker from the 7, and keeps the other one spare so that the anchor on 18 can stay intact, in case there’s another chance to hit {{opponent}} in a few turns.

      In reflection:
      1. {{opponent}}’s 6-5 roll shaped the entire strategy for all of {{opponent}}’s rolls that came after – a race. Already by {{opponent}}’s 2nd roll, there was only 1 checker at the back.
      2. {{opponent}} won the game, but was hit in the open field along the way. You can win a race game despite being hit, but try to minimize it.
      3. You want the pip count in your favor – at least half an average roll, 4 pips. If the other player’s pip count starts going in their direction, let’s say they roll a big double, the game state has changed. You need to think about switching strategies.
      4. Toward the end of the game, {{{player}} wasn’t only behind in the race. {{player}} was also contained at the 18, forced to move pieces that were already in O’s inner-board in order to have a chance of hitting {{opponent}} . That’s called “wasting” moves.

      Now we’re going to look at some individual moments that get into important parts of the running game strategy.      
      Let’s start with – when do you run  White?
      Here are 4 routes to go on a 5-3 roll.
    choices:
      - Give more flexibility to your inner board development, and send a checker from 13/8, and then 13/10
      - Build a new point in your inner board – of some strategic bonus? 8/3, 6/3
      - Move your back checker from 24/21 and then 21/16 and make a run for it.
      - Move your back checker to be ready the next turn to escape and develop my inner board a bit, 24/21, 8/3.
    correct: 3
    xgid: XGID=-a----EBF---bB---adcb--b--:0:0:-1:53:0:0:0:0:10
    hint: If it puts you ahead in the pip count, run with your back checker as far as you can – don’t wait for next turn to escape. You’ll be 1 roll ahead of the opponent when it’s their turn, 8 pips. That player has to roll a 4 to hit you.
