      Good players develop a feel for the 21 possible outcomes of two dice rolls.
      They also develop the patience to pause and count to figure out the probabilities when they don’t immediately come to mind. 
      
      The more often you pause to count out the possibilities on a backgammon board, the more often it will immediately come to mind.
      
      The objective here, is to work through finding the probability of getting a dice roll you need.

      Lets look at the possible rolls you can get. This is the basis of everything we need when making tough decisions in backgammon.
      
      Can you see from this what the most likely number to get is?
      
      Think of all the numbers that add together to give each number that you can roll

      Lets look at the likelihood now of getting a specific number. There is an important pattern to try and learn here. Can you see what it is?
      
      Look at the colouring of the percentage chance of you getting a number. 6 is the most likely so you want to avoid leaving pieces unprotected, 6 away from an opponent.

      On the other hand, if you need a 6 its far more likely that you'll get it than any other number. You can use this to your advantage.

      Have a play by hovering on the probabilities and see how the rolls change that make some numbers easier than others.

      One of the first big surprises of the dice: your chances of rolling a 7 or an 8 are equal. Think about what that means for when you’re playing… you are just as safe at 7 away from a checker as you are 8.
      
      In a game then, you don't need to use up a 1 to move from 8 away, to 7 away, it's the same odds. Use your 1 more wisely.
