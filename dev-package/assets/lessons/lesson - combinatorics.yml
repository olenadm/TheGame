      Good players begin to develop a feel for playing the game in terms of 21 possible outcomes of two dice rolls. They develop the feel through patience to pause and count to figure out the probabilities
      The more often you pause to count out the possibilities on a backgammon board, the more often it will immediately come to mind, the more it arrives at the level of feel.

      If you want to get past beginner level at Backgammon,  develop a natural sense for the probabilities of the game.
      The first chart is the most important – the possible combinations of rolling two six-sided dice.
      These are all the possible rolls in the game – What are the odds of being able to move a checker 4 spaces ahead with the roll of two dice?

      Now let’s look at chances to hit the opponent’s checker within a distance of 6 spaces. There's a new chart to look at. 
      Rolling one of the dice, the chances of hitting any space within six is equal – 11/36.
      How much better of a chance do you have of rolling a 6 using two dice, than with one?

      Taking the lessons of raw dice math to the backgammon board, let’s look at chances to hit the opponent’s checker within a distance of 6 spaces.
      With one of the dice, the chances of hitting any space within six is equal – 11/36. With two – the odds go up: unevenly.
      How much better of a chance do you have of rolling a number that amounts to 6 with two dice, than with 5?"
    hint: |
      Combinatorics are often about adding everything up, and then making a calculation on what the better odds are you might be able to hit, or escape, or build a new anchor. There are multiple choices like that usually, each turn. So … patiently learn it here.

      There’s one more key part of the game involving dice roll probabilities – the chances you or your opponent can roll back of the bar.
      At the start of the game, each player has their own six point pre-filled. And barring disaster, it’s the opening odds for thinking about the chances that a checker will be back in play: There’s a 97% chance a checker can roll back on to the game board if only the 6 point is occupied by an anchor – because only a double 6 will block a player from rolling in.
      It’s from here that you can think about the relative value of filling in your inner board, or avoid getting hit – the odds of rolling in are quite good with two points filled at 90%. The big drop off goes from having a 4 point board to a 5 point board.\n\nMany players are better at playing in terms of the real probabilities that their opponents will roll in than their own probabilities of rolling in when they come off the bar. That's a normal bias, but it will cost you if you don't level it out."
