      Lets look at the possible rolls you can get. This is the basis of everything we need when making tough decisions in backgammon.
      
      Can you see from this what the most likely number to get is?
      
      Think of all the numbers that add together to give each number that you can roll

      Lets look at the likelihood now of getting a specific number. There is an important pattern to try and learn here. Can you see what it is?
      
      Look at the colouring of the percentage chance of you getting a number. 6 is the most likely so you want to avoid leaving pieces unprotected, 6 away from an opponent.

      On the other hand, if you need a 6 its far more likely that you'll get it than any other number. You can use this to your advantage.

      One of the first big surprises of the dice: your chances of rolling a 7 or an 8 are equal. Think about what that means for when you’re playing… you are just as safe at 7 away from a checker as you are 8.
      
      In a game then, you don't need to use up a 1 to move from 8 away, to 7 away, it's the same odds. Use your 1 more wisely.
