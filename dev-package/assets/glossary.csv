The other two sets are referred to as the opponent’s home board or the opponent’s outer board.To start the game, players have to line up their checkers on their respective boards. Each player is given 15 checkers. Of these fifteen, the player has to place two checkers on the twenty-four point (point marked on the board), five checkers of the thirteen point, and three checkers on the eight-point and the other five of the player’s six point. Before the game starts, the players also have to ensure that they have their dice, a dice cup and an optional doubling cube (whose face values range from 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64). When playing the game, one player will have to move their checkers in a clockwise direction while the other player has to move their checkers in the opposite direction. The number of steps that a player moves their checkers is determined by the roll of the dice. The player can only move their checkers to a point that is not already occupied by the opponent’s checkers. When it comes to rolling the dice (player rolls the dice twice at once), the player may add the total value of the dice rolls (suppose one dice roll returned 2 and the other 5, the player will add the two to get a total of 7) and thereby move their checkers for a number of steps that correspond with the total of the two dice rolls. At the same time, the player may choose not to add the total of the two dice rolls, rather, they will move one checker two points and the other checker 5 points.",Fundamentals,Beginner,,,,,,,,,,,
